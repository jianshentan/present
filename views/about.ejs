      <div class="question">What exactly should we use Silent.Buzz for?</div>
      <div class="answer">It's really up to you! Maybe you just want to see how many people you can accumulate on an online address, or maybe you want to throw a silent protest. It's really up to you guys to decide. <br><br>Perhaps these use-cases below would spark some creativity:</div>

      <div class="question">Can we use Silent.Buzz to vote / see who is more popular?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes - this really depends on how you choose the name for your online space. For example, we could have a @SupportBernie and a @SupportClinton space. Imagine how political campaigns would use this:</div>

      <div class="question">Do you plan on developing a mobile app for Silent?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, this is what we're working on next. However, having said that, we felt that making for browsers was most suitable because it really emphasises the important of the url.<br><br>The mobile app will also be really conscious of this- that the URL is the thing that people will want to share.</div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="question">Why did you make Silent?</div>
      <div class="answer">Silent falls into a tradition of the simplification of digital communication. The trajectory is clear: digital communication is being modularized. Think about Facebook, and how from then, Twitter, and then Snapchat were created, and eventually Yo. <br><br>Each service simplifies one part of the grandiose challenge of digital + social communication. Silent gets to the core of online camaraderie. Its not about the content, instead its about being online together, taking comfort in each others presense. </div>
